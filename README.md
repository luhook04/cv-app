# cv-app


[Live Preview](https://luhook04.github.io/cv-app/)

This app allows you to input information in a form and automatically create a CV based on the input. This project was built to practice with Class components and passing state and props. However, I also wanted to practice Hooks and get better use of GitHub, so I re-wrote the app with functional components using hooks.
